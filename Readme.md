# Gita @ Screen

## :notebook: Overview

**Gita @ Screen is a website created for the people across the world who are interested in Bhagvad Gita. This is my tribute to the _Hindu_ dharma. Users can choose Gita slokas from the units of their choice and can read it at their own language like _Hindi_ , _Sanskrit_ and _English_. They can also read the description and context of that sloka in all of these languages.**

## :warning: Warning

**I am a developer. I don't have any intention to discriminate any other dharmas. As a Hindu guy I have built this project just to show my tribute. I am neither associated nor representing any community. I am a developer for all.**
